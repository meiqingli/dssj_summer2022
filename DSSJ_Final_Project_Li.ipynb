        "## Introduction\n",
        "The subreddit of interest is [Publishing](https://www.reddit.com/r/publishing/), which is a community for publishing professionals to discuss various issues such as career and business opportunities. Through initial qualitative analysis, we found it a relatively small community compared with other subreddits by number of readers and posts. In terms of topics, we found discussions on different types of publishing, for example self-publishing,publishing through agent, and digital publishing, as well as publishing in the US vs. Canada. These are all potential areas for further investigation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Before cleaning up, our dataset includes 7,330 posts and 19,538 comments. By removing blank texts, we reduced the size of dataset to 2,388 posts and 19,054 comments. There have been a total of 1,922 unique users for posts, and 4,033 unique users for comments. Interestingly, we noticed that the most frequent user's posts take up 1% of the overall posts while the next only takes up 0.3%. Another observation we find interesting is that people are curious about the differences in publishing between US and Canada, whilst it seems that most of the posts are from people trying to navigate publishing but very little from the publisher side. For this project, I would like to look into the posts by different people involved in publishing, specifically the themes and sentiments within posts from different areas or regions. For example, how do the sentiments and concerns regarding publishing differ between US, Canada and other countries, or different parts of the US? Also, within each geographic region, what are the shares of posts by people interested in publishing, publishers, agents, and other stakeholders? I am interested in studying these dynamics because they can give us a better understanding about the broader landscape of publishing. \n",
        "\n",
        "In order to address these questions, I will look into several NLP techniques inlcuding *topic modeling* and *sentiment analysis*. Specifically, I will use tools such as *concordance* to identify texts with geographical key words, then extract topical words and sentiments. "
