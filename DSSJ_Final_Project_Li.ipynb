        "## Introduction\n",
        "The subreddit of interest is [Publishing](https://www.reddit.com/r/publishing/), which is a community for publishing professionals to discuss various issues such as career and business opportunities. Through initial qualitative analysis, we found it a relatively small community compared with other subreddits by number of readers and posts. In terms of topics, we found discussions on different types of publishing, for example self-publishing,publishing through agent, and digital publishing, as well as publishing in the US vs. Canada. These are all potential areas for further investigation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Before cleaning up, our dataset includes 7,330 posts and 19,538 comments. By removing blank texts, we reduced the size of dataset to 2,388 posts and 19,054 comments. There have been a total of 1,922 unique users for posts, and 4,033 unique users for comments. Interestingly, we noticed that the most frequent user's posts take up 1% of the overall posts while the next only takes up 0.3%. Another observation we find interesting is that people are curious about the differences in publishing between US and Canada, whilst it seems that most of the posts are from people trying to navigate publishing but very little from the publisher side. For this project, I would like to look into the posts by different people involved in publishing, specifically the themes and sentiments within posts from different areas or regions. For example, how do the sentiments and concerns regarding publishing differ between US, Canada and other countries, or different parts of the US? Also, within each geographic region, what are the shares of posts by people interested in publishing, publishers, agents, and other stakeholders? I am interested in studying these dynamics because they can give us a better understanding about the broader landscape of publishing. \n",
        "\n",
        "In order to address these questions, I will look into several NLP techniques inlcuding *topic modeling* and *sentiment analysis*. Specifically, I will use tools such as *concordance* to identify texts with geographical key words, then extract topical words and sentiments. "

            "The tourists are extremely varied. Lot of domestic tourism, plenty from the Commonwealth, the States, East Asia, Europe, and so on. I'm more interested in the workforce though—we don't market ourselves to tourists. They're barred from any community groups we run generally. We hope to speak to the lived experience of the people who actually live and work in Canadian ski resort towns. They tend to be a fun, informed, and varied group. Much more fun to write for.\n",

I had asked their concierge if they had any spicy stories and that request went up the chain. Right after, there was a flood of people into our Facebook groups from the Fairmont's frontline staff.

            "\n",
            "In late 2018, I published a book with an indie publisher based in UK. I'm based in the US. As is standard for most indie publishers, the royalty percentage was much higher -- 20% -- but with no advance. I signed a contract with them back in 2016, motivated by the higher royalty percentage and being an author without as big of a platform. (I actually met one of their editors at AWP in  2016, which launched the conversation that led to the book.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, the people I worked with at first were great. But later on, there were all sorts of yellow flags with this publisher, but only after I signed my contract:  weird staff shake-ups, angry Twitter threads about interactions with the head of the company, way less editing than I thought there would be. Whatever, I thought. I signed a contract, I hoped for the best. \n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, in 2019 they paid me royalties for the 2018 (which wasn't much cuz the book came out in late november 2018). Much later than they should have -- my contract stipulates they send them out by July of the next year -- but they did pay them. \n",
            "\n",
            "However, at this point, I am more excited about my 2019 fiscal year royalties, because I know the book went to its second print run and also got converted to an ebook. So I'm super excited for my royalty check from the fiscal year 2019. \n",
            "\n",
            "So July 2020 comes along, they still haven't sent me my 2019 royalty statement. I bother them every few months. They say in November 2020 they'll get to it soon and tell me I sold 99 e-books. They don't tell me how many print books I sold.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then 2021 comes along and I still don't have any of my 2019 royalties. I email the publisher for like the tenth time. He says that they're having financial issues because of COVID, although his words are sort of vague, like, he doesn't really specify what's going on or why they're not honoring the contract.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is shady for a few reasons. First, modern account practices generally dictate that if you know that 20% of your revenue of a given product are going to royalties, you would set them aside immediately upon receipt -- rather than put them in a checking account and spend them and figure it out later. It's very shady accounting. \n",
            "\n",
            "Second, it's curious because the press has been really busy the past two years -- they acquired one or two other publishers and are clearly in growth mode. \n",
            "\n",
            "Third, even if they were having financial issues due to COVID, I'm talking about royalties from fiscal year 2019, not any span of 2020. \n",
            "\n",
            "So now I'm at a crossroads, and I'm not sure what to do. Obviously, they're not upholding their end of the contract. But also, as a US citizen not a UK citizen, I'm not sure how much power I have here to get them to pay up. I feel like my options are: \n",
            "\n",
            "1.) argue with this publisher over email and bring up exactly what I said to you above, about why this is curious. Be demanding, and see what happens. \n",
            "\n",
            "2.) File a [court claim for money](https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money) with the UK government. The problem is that I don't precisely know how much money I'm owed, because they haven't told me exactly how many books I sold in 2019. Also, it's more bureaucratically complicated to fill out these forms when you don't know how much money you're owed. \n",
            "\n",
            "I imagine a legal threat like this would probably work inasmuch as getting paid, but would also burn a lot of bridges and maybe would make it harder to do in the future. It also costs money to file these things. (It costs less if I know how much I'm owed)\n",
            "\n",
            "3) I could do a hybrid of the previous two: if I email the publisher politely and say, \"oh, sorry to hear. For my own ego's sake, i'm curious how many e-books and print books I sold in 2019. Would you be able at least to get me that data?\" Then, armed with this email with those numbers, I file a UK court claim knowing exactly how much I'm owed, which makes it easier and cheaper to file. \n",

            "1. The sooner you apply to a job after it's posting, the better chance you have of getting an interview. I don't think any HR manager will admit this, and it's definitely not strictly true for everything, but in all of the jobs I applied to, I don't think I ever got an interview for one that I applied for after a week of its listing (In my job search, I interviewed at one Big 5 co for editorial and at four or five agencies/scouting companies)\n",
            "2. Jobs move by word of mouth. Reach out to publishing professionals at the assistant & associate levels via Linkedin to request informational interviews & build your network; once you have people you're acquainted with, email them if you apply to their company. Oftentimes they can flag your resume for HR (each company has a different process for this though)\n",

            "4. Try to find work in a bookstore while you're applying/charting your next move - you will want to be very knowledgable about the books that have published and are being pushed by booksellers. You don't need to know every big book of every season, nor do you need to read every book, but name recognition will go a long way \n",
            "5. Use an NYC, NJ, or CT address on your resume (you don't actually have to live there, can be a friend's, but most companies will filter out resumes that require relocation or will want someone who can start immediately \\*in normal times\\*)\n",
            "6. Some big companies do cold calls to screen candidates before offering an interview - make sure your voicemail message is professional\n",
            "7. In your cover letter, which should be tailored for each job/imprint/company, mention books from the imprint that you love - some have their lists more easily displayed on their websites, others you'll want to check out their social media to see which are the big books they're hyping\n",
            "8. Your resume should be absolutely pristine. Consider paying someone to go through it for you\n",
            "9. Your internships don't need to be in book publishing, but should be related to media. Try small magazines and newspapers.\n",
            "10. If you're still in college, definitely look into an internship at your school's university press. You should also look into joining your school's writing center (or equivalent, where student mentors assist with writing assignments), literary magazine, and/or newspaper\n",
            "11. Send a thank you email within 24 hours of your interview\n",

Editorial teams make sure that the content is consistent, sellable, correct, proofed, and both economical and appealing in terms of typographical layout. Designers create the ‘oomph’ needed to draw in a customer, even to develop a brand identity for the author, series or publisher. The production team are the logisticians - they make sure the product is profitable, achievable, safe, and right for the market and the content, itself. Rights and Sales do the legwork to get that product in shops, online, around the world. And they feed back, real-time, into every other department during the whole process - and beyond. \n",

The product could end up being harmful (non-safe inks, for example, used in children’s books), or too many copies are printed. And market estimates and rights contracts could fall through.

Publishing is *changing*, all the time, and requires so many new skills. We’re just in a weird sort of ‘transition’ period, where these skills don’t quite *count* as valuable yet, so crucial roles are not recognised fully.

One thing you’ll definitely want to look into are internships, so hopefully your program will allow for that. If trade is what you’re interested in, this means you’ll most likely be looking at available roles in NYC, with smaller pools of possibilities in California, Washington, DC, Miami (if you’re Spanish fluent—Penguin Random House has their Grupo Editorial office there) and a smattering of other larger cities.

To prepare for the interview, there was A LOT of research on the trade market, the house’s imprints, their key titles, and their social strategies for promoting those titles. I’m super generalizing a lot here, and even then this advice suits the creative side of marketing.

            "To be quite honest, I don't think there is necessarily a single common approach when it comes to 'entering' (which encompasses creating/writing copy, getting salient details like price, territory, dates, etc, and ensuring data is feeding live to data recipients) metadata for ebooks. I've worked at 3 publishing houses and it was somewhat different at all. I'm not sure about online resources. BookNet Canada is a good resource but like you say tends to focus more on publishing professionals rather than giving overviews of workflow. There are companies out there that offer end-to-end ebook services to publishing companies - ebook creation, validation, metadata distribution, etc - so if your company uses a service like that, you'll have a very different workflow, compared to a company that does everything in house.\n",
            "\n",
            "In my opinion, *ideally* you want a similar workflow for ebooks, as for physical books; something where the majority of the non-format specific metadata pulls from a 'primary' record for that work, with secondary info being populated as required (which could be quite different for ebooks and physical books). It might also interest you to know that each retailer tends to have differences in the kind of metadata they accept, and how they use and display that metadata also. Depending on which retailers are important to your company - which is likely a function of the market you publish into, and the kinds of books you publish - you may well prioritise populating certain fields over others, and that'd also shape one's workflow. To give you some examples, text-heavy books might be getting excerpts populated to give some sense of textual style. Image heavy books like cookbooks or design books will likely want to have more emphasis on interior images. For high profile books or 'best seller' books you may want to emphasise that with the use of quotes, industry reviews, endorsements, etc etc. There are a LOT of variations, and just an absolute shitload of detail that one *could* include on a title metadata record, regardless of whether that is p- or e-book.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "One thing that may not be too obvious as well, is that it takes time and resources to populate metadata. I hear you thinking \"geting an excerpt, images and quotes can't take that much time\". Multiply that by approximately 50-100 fields; there's *at least* that amount of data on a basic record, and you want it all to be right, and good! The more retailers and data recipients you want to cater for, the more sophisticated your systems need to be, or you need to pay more staff to manage the data. Publishing houses in my experience tend not to have cash to throw around on these things unless they're big. So - investment of time and resources is another factor that will really shape the workflow (and indeed the ebook products themselves).\n",

So if the contract says worldwide rights with 25% net to the author on any foreign sales, that's what you get, if any such deals are made. However, you likely have zero control over whether/how those deals happen.

The ROW point puts you in a better position to offer it to a US publisher further down the line if that's what you want. Most UK publishers will be familiar with those kinds of contracts; we tend to buy in manuscripts already bought in the US a lot, and those are standard contracts in such cases.

Build their publsihing resume and get gigs and eventual deals (super common, more common that \"followers\")  that way too. Its not just followers. Also, most people write wack poetry and the ones with the followers right wack poetry that sells. go write that but nobody will care you died in one hundred years.

What are the titles they’re currently working on etc? If it’s a specific imprint, follow their social media pages closely and try to keep up to date on what is going on in order to get a feel of what the imprint stands for/what their niche or mission is with their publishing. In addition to this, keep a tabs on the bestsellers list – I’m assuming for you it would be The New York Times as the main list to watch, as well as the Amazon bestsellers list. Try to familiarise yourself with the most recent successful titles (in the last year or so, especially ones which may be comparative/competitive titles for the specific publisher or imprint that you’re applying for) – as it’s great to get a sense of what books are being currently talked about and/or frequently referenced in pitch meetings.

The degrees are used strictly as a way to choose who gets the job. Even so most people with degrees are turned down.

            "*Lastly, international distribution is less impressive than it sounds. I can upload to Amazon and have international distribution. And I can register an ISBN for a few quid and be 'available' in all good bookstores; if you visit those bookstores' websites, though, are the books actually available to order and receive* within a few days? *If not, then the publisher doesn't have proper distribution or the book's are out of print; if it's the case for most of their books, it's probably the former.*\n",

            "Hi, I've recently closed submissions as I've got too many to read through at the moment. My aim is to take on 12 in total within the first 2 years of business. I'm only accepting submissions from UK based authors though. {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.939, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': 0.3818}\n",

            "—Generally the biggest of the best sellers do well in both nations while some authors do well in one but not another (usually because of tone or using colloquialisms recognizable to one nation but not another).\n",
